"""
Description:
    - for some .eaf files, probably .eafs whose audio files were converted
    improperly, the alignment between annotations and audio grows increasingly
    greater over the course of the file
HOW TO USE:
    - get the start time stamp at which the annotations and audio are correctly
    linked (likely 0, the beginning of the file)
    - get the end time stamp: the offset of the last annotation you are
    interested in
    - measure how many milliseconds skew there is between the last annotation
    and its linked audio
    - call this script from the directory that contains the .eaf file
        - input the start time, end time, and the skewed difference
    - the script will rescale all the time values within the start and end
    times and give you the option to over-write the original .eaf with these
    new values
